Dungeon Crawler 🎮

A 2D action-adventure game with AI-driven enemies, dynamic combat mechanics, and immersive world-building.

🏆 Project Overview
Python Adventure Game is a 2D action-adventure game developed using Python and Pygame, featuring AI-driven enemies, interactive environments, and fluid combat mechanics. Players navigate through handcrafted levels, battling enemies, and collecting coins. The game incorporates sprite-based animations, tile-based level design, and real-time event handling, making for a rich and engaging gameplay experience.

⚙ Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language for game logic and mechanics
Pygame – Handles graphics, animation, and game loop execution
AI Pathfinding – Enemy AI uses basic state-based behavior (idle, attack, patrol)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Modular design with classes for characters, items, weapons, and environments
Collision Detection – Implemented using Pygame’s rect-based collision system
Event-Driven System – Keyboard input and game state management for a responsive experience
Audio Integration – Background music, sound effects for actions like attacks and item pickups
🎮 Gameplay Features
Combat System – Ranged and melee attacks with weapons like bows, fireballs, and arrows
AI-Driven Enemies – Goblins, skeletons, imps, and more use state-based AI for patrolling, chasing, and attacking
Level Progression – Multiple handcrafted levels with increasing difficulty and enemy density
Interactive Items – Collect coins and health potions
Dynamic Animations – Smooth character movement, enemy reactions, and attack effects
🚀 How It Works
The player moves using keyboard controls, attacking enemies and avoiding obstacles.
Enemy AI detects the player within a certain range and reacts dynamically (e.g., chasing when close, returning to patrol when out of sight).
The game world is built using tile-based level design, allowing for scalable and modular environments.
Weapons have cooldown mechanics and hit detection to create a balanced combat system.
Health and power-up items strategically placed throughout levels encourage exploration.
